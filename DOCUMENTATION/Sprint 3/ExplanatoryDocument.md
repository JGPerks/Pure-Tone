# Waveform Changing and New Keyboard Layout
The Big Oil Beats (BOB) Pure Tone Keyboard allows for users to see which keys produce sounds.
The keyboard is split into two main sections of both letter notes and their sharp versions.  
The user can change the octave and the waveform of a specific section.  The diagram below shows this.
The number and QWER rows being one section. The ASDF and ZXCV rows being the second section.  
Buttons on either end of the letter note rows (Tab and left bracket for top section, Lshift 
and Rshift for bottom section) are used to shift the pitch of the section up (right key) or down (left key). 
Within the diagram, these keys are highlighted in blue.
A box to the right of the keyboard section would show which octave the section is currently on. 

In order to change the waveform, the user must hit a key in the section (right bracket and backslash for the top, right alt and right control for the bottom) that would change 
the waveform played by all the keys to the last or next waveform, as determined within a preset list and based on which button was changed (left button goes 
back in list, right button goes forward).  These buttons are represented in violet. This change would also be represented on the right of the section, past 
the octave number, by a box depicting the current waveform selected.
