# Waveform Changing and New Keyboard Layout
The Big Oil Beats (BOB) Pure Tone Keyboard allows for users to see which keys produce sounds.
The keyboard is split into two main sections of both letter notes and their sharp versions.  
The user can change the octave and the waveform of a specific section.  The diagram below shows this.

The number and QWER rows are one section. The ASDF and ZXCV rows being the second section. If you press the buttons they will make a noise. The noise is that of a keyboard. The idea is to have a keyboard instrument.

Highlighted in blue: Buttons on either end of the letter note rows (Tab and left bracket for top section, Lshift 
and Rshift for bottom section) are used to shift the pitch of the section up (right key) or down (left key). 
Again, within the diagram, these keys are highlighted in blue.

A box to the right of the keyboard section shows the type of wave being produced along with which octave the section is currently on. 

Highlighted in violet: In order to change the waveform, the user must hit a key in the section (right bracket and backslash for the top, right alt and right control for the bottom). Right bracket and backslash for the top, right alt and right control for the bottom changes the waveform played by all the keys to the last or next waveform. The waveform is determined within a preset list and based on which button was changed (left button goes back in list, right button goes forward). Again, these buttons are represented in violet.
