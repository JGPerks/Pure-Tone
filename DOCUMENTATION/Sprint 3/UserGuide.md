> Highlighted in blue: Buttons on either end of the letter note rows (being Tab and left bracket for top section, Lshift and Rshift for bottom section) are used to shift the pitch of the section up (right key) or down (left key).
> Highlighted in violet: In order to change the waveform, the user must hit a key in the section (right bracket and backslash for the top, right alt and right control for the bottom). Right bracket and backslash for the top, right alt and right control for the bottom changes the waveform played by all the keys to the last or next waveform. The waveform is determined within a preset list and based on which button was changed (left button goes back in list, right button goes forward).
> The black buttons are null
