# SPRINT 1 SUMMARY

Sprint 1 consisted of planning, design, discovery, implementation, programming, security, and documentation. 

Thus far we have an:
- Oscilloscope GUI
- Keyboard GUI
- Music keysounds
- Recording feature

Imports being used include:
- pygame: "pygame (the library) is a Free and Open Source python programming language library for making multimedia applications like games." https://www.pygame.org/news 
- tkinter: "The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit." tkinter helps build GUIs in Python. https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter
- argparse: A module that makes parsing command-line arguments more efficient and convenient for users. "Command-line arguments are values passed to a program or script when it is executed from the command line or terminal." argparse can auotmatically generate help and usage messages. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-option-and-argument-parsing-using-argparse-in-python/
  Parsing is used when:
  (a) Reading Data Formats: Use pasing to interpret structured data formats (ex: JSON, XML, or CSV) where the data is represented as text with a specific syntax.
  (b) Compiling Programming Languages: During compilation, parsing is used to analyze the source code of a programming language and convert it into a format that can be executed by the computer.
  (c) Command-Line Arguments: When a program receives command-line arguments, parsing is used to extract and interpret these arguments to determine the program's behavior.
- keyboardlayout: "A python library to display different keyboards." https://pypi.org/project/keyboardlayout/
- playsound: Plays sound files in Python. https://pypi.org/project/playsound/
- PySimpleGUI: "PySimpleGUI creates graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using Python, quickly and easily!" https://www.pysimplegui.com/
- pyaudio: from PortAudio library. Allows for interaction with audio devices like microphones, speakers, etc. Can do audio input and output. Can do playback and recording. https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/ 
- numpy: Used for scientific computing tasks. Many different numerical computing capabilities. https://numpy.org/
- matplotlib: "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations." https://matplotlib.org/stable/
