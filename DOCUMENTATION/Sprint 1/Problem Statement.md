# Problem Statement
## What is the problem?
There is currently no way to playback custom pure tone sounds via a python app with real time graphing.

## Why is a solution needed?
It is cool and fun. Good plugins for other software are expensive.

## What is the void being filled?
There are not a lot of free options for similar pure tone sound generators.

## Who will use the system?
People who like playing music and enjoying look at pretty graphs will enjoy using our pure tone keyboard.
