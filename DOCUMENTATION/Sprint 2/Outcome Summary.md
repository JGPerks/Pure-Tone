## Expected Outcome
- A GUI will be developed to display an oscilloscope.
- Keys will be uniquely binded to play their own seperate pure tone waveform.
- A chromatic scale will be implemented into our keyboard.
- Key presses will trigger their respective waveform and last as long as they are held.
- Active waveforms will be shown on the oscilloscope.
- Two buttons will be implemented, one to start recording and the other to stop recording.

## Final Product
We intend on delivering a pure tone keyboard with a GUI to display our oscilloscope, adding an option to either start or stop recording.
