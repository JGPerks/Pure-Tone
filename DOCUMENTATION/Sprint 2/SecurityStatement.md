## Security Statement
Security Concerns that will be focused on include:
1. User Input - User input will be limited to only the keys that appear on the keyboard GUI when running the program. Besides this, the user will have the option to customize the keyboard or exit the program entirely.
2. Data Breaching - Access to user data will be restricted for all users except for those who are authorized to ensure the security of all sensitive information.
3. User Authentication and Authorization - While probably won't be implemented within the end of the three-week scope it is possible to add authentication for users to access the software. Users would be required to input a username and password before accessing the software.
4. Secure Storage of Data - Keeping data secure will be prioritized by keeping all data stored locally to ensure efficient control and protection from unauthorized users.
