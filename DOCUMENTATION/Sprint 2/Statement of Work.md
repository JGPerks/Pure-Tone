## Objectives
- Play sinusodial waveforms from the keyboard.
- Bind keys to unique waveforms.
- Create an oscilloscope to view waveforms.
- Allow multiple keys/waveforms to be played at once.
- Create start and stop recording buttons and save audio as .wav file.

## Scope
- We will play unique waveforms binded to keys on the keyboard using Python.
- Multiple waveforms can be played.
- These waveforms will generate sound.
- An oscilloscope will display our waveform or polytonality in a window.

## Expectations
- We expect a program that will handle multiple user key presses and generate the appropriate waveform.
- This waveform will be displayed in our window.
- You will be able to close this window whenever you'd like.
- We expect the user to find it intuitive.
