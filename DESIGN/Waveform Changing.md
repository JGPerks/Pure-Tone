# Waveform Changing and New Keyboard Layout
In the upcoming iteration of the Big Oil Beats (BOB) keyboard, the keyboard will undergo a redesign to allow the user to see which keys produce sounds.
In addition to this, the keyboard will be split into two main sections of both letter notes and their sharp versions.  This is to allow for another change 
that will allow the user to change the octave and the waveform of a specific section.  The diagram below shows this, with the number and QWER rows being one 
section and the ASDF and ZXCV rows being the second section.  Buttons on either end of the letter note rows (Tab and left bracket for top section, Lshift 
and Rshift for bottom section) would be used to shift the pitch of the section up (right key) or down (left key). Within the diagram, these keys are 
highlighted in orange. A box to the right of the keyboard section would show which octave the section is currently on. Finally, in order to change the 
waveform, the user would hit a key in the section (right bracket and backslash for the top, right alt and right control for the bottom) that would change 
the waveform played by all the keys to the last or next waveform, as determined within a preset list and based on which button was changed (left button goes 
back in list, right button goes forward).  This change would also be represented on the right of the section, past the octave number, by a box depicting the 
current waveform selected.
